1. Do itoa - Done
2. Go through atoi - Done
3. Do strjoin - Done
4. ft_split - Done
5. figure out how different forms of string initialization work. - Done



FOR FINAL EXAM:-

1. Do itoa 
2. Go through atoi 
3. Do strjoin 
4. ft_split 
5. Figure out linked list questions too
6. C11 has advanced programs, it deals with function pointers.
7. C12 deals with linked lists and structures.
8. C13 deals with trees.
9. brainfart question I guess lol.

Structures:

Structures allow us to store different types of data in a single location. 

Think of it like a box which contains all these different data types.

Structures allow us to create arrays which contains multiple different data types essentially.

Structure is a user-defined data type. We define it using the primitive data types like int float char etc.
